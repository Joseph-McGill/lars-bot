# LarsBot Discord Bot

A Discord bot written in Node.js using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) that mimics an online friend of mine (Lars) using various voice clips and typing mannerisms. Since Lars is a close friend of mine this project will not include the actual audio files to protect his privacy. I've included an `example.mp3` in the sounds directory as a reference for adding more sound clips.

The bot was created to test out [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) functionality and get feel for how Discord handles API interactions and slash commands before making a more complicated bot.
