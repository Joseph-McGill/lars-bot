# LarsBot Discord Bot

A Discord bot written in Python 3.10 using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) that mimics an online friend of mine (Lars) using various voice clips and typing mannerisms. Since Lars is a close friend of mine this project will not include the actual audio files to protect his privacy. I've included an `example.mp3` in the sounds folder as a reference for adding more sound clips.

The bot was created to test out [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) functionality and get feel for how Disord handles API interactions before making a more complicated bot.
